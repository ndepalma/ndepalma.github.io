| I am an independent researcher and engineer interested in vision and language systems toward creating seemless interactions between agents and users. In the past, I have been a visiting research scientist at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) working with [Jessica Hodgins](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/), I have graduated from [MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/) while being advised by [Cynthia Breazeal](https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/), and I was a Research Engineer at the [Samsung AI Center](https://sra.samsung.com/research-area/artificial-intelligence/).  | ![Nick on the beach](images/NickHappy2.PNG ) |

<!-- My past interests are in understanding the underlying principles behind robotic systems that can communicate with humans. This includes both responding to human nonverbal signals as well as generating those signals as well. I prefer to synthesize commonly understood cognitive processes toward this end. -->
