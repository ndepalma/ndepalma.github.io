excerpt: Authoring autonomous behaviors can be seen as *the* problem to solve in smart, interactive robotics. Systems like Fa√ßade require complex behavior authoring that can take years to fully build. Mars Escape was inspired by Orkin's Restaurant Game in which everyday users take on the roles of agents in an interaction and provide authoring data that can be mined for behaviors that an autonomous agent can leverage. This was a novel project that leveraged virtual characters online to learn new behaviors that the robot could use in the real world.

Learning behaviors from a virtual agent
</center>

Authoring complex behaviors for robotic agents has always been prohibitively expensive. Inspired by the Restaurant Game, this project seeks to explore the idea of data-driven behaviors, sourced from a crowd of people that act as if they are taking on the social role of a robot in a mock up cooperative task. After collecting these new behaviors from the internet, our robot, Nexi, utilized these situated actions in a real world task, interacting with everyday users at the Boston Museum of Science.
