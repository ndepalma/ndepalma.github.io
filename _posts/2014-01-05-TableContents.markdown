* \[September. 2023\] Apologies for the lack of updates:
  * This year I have two journal pieces coming out in January 2024.
  * Are you interested in the intersection of deep learning and human robot interaction? Then please [consider submitting](https://tahri.org/) to TAHRI, a new symposia I'm helping to contribute to that will try to bring these two communities together.
  * I am now contributing actively to the semio community project, a non profit that will be building open source social robotics software. Early projects include [Oculator](https://github.com/semio-ai/oculator/), a visual cognitive architecture for driving active vision for [Quori](http://www.quori.org/about).
* \[Oct. 2019\] I'm currently a guest editor for the Special Issue for the Journal of Community Well Being. Please [consider submitting](https://ijcw.github.io/call-for-abstracts/) your research on the Intersections of Artificial Intelligence and Community Well-Being! 
* \[Nov. 2019\] Transitioned from Samsung Research of America to Facebook AI.
* \[Jul.-Nov. 2019\] Co-organized AAAI Fall Symposium Series Artificial Intelligence and Human-Robot Interaction for Service Robots in Human Environments ([website](https://ai-hri.github.io/2019/))
