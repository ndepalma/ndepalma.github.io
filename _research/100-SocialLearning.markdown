excerpt: Social learning mechanisms as defined by Tomasello in <em>The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition</em> employ more than imitation learning, which is the most common type of learning in robotics. It can also be defined as learning through emulation, stimulus enhancement, and mimicking. We define novel differentiations between these mechanisms that were modeled after Tomasello's definition and characterize their effects to understand their role in social learning.

Social learning in robotics has largely focused on imitation learning. In this work, we take a broader view of social learning and are interested in the multifaceted ways that a social partner can inﬂuence the learning process. We implement stimulus enhancement and emulation on a robot, and illustrate the computational beneﬁts of social learning over self exploration. Additionally we characterize the differences between these two social learning strategies, showing that the preferred strategy is dependent on the current behavior of the social partner.
