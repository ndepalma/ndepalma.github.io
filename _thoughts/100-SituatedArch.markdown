excerpt: This essay is about the history of situated architectures and whether or not they still deserve our attention. 
# definition of Cybernetics

I recently used a term|cybernetics in one of my talks that I meant deeply but didn't have a chance to really dig in to. *Cybernetics* is a term that has fallen out of favor and that's to our own disservice as it was a term that helped people think critically about the problems and ideas that they had to generate more rigorous models of their phenomena. What is it about social robotics that characterizes it against Human Robot Interaction? I will argue that it's about cybernetics. 

_A Revolution in Situatedness_
One of the realizations late in the intelligent agents game seems to be when researchers began to realize that the agent is dependent on the environment and that the environment is dependent on the agent. This mutual dependence forces us to think not just about the model being learned 
I want to use this moment to talk about some advantages of situated approaches that don't get much press in popular journals. 

_Binding, Affordances, and External Memory_

_"The Interactive Dataset"_

_Interacting with the Environment, Interacting with a Social Agent_

_Social Robotics vs. HRI_

This is an essay in progress. I will reveal more as I get time to do so.
