excerpt: Joint attention is a social phonemena involving the continuous exchange of referential gestures to direct attention for the purpose of reference resolution. It's typically directed toward targets external to ongoing dialog. This external target to the text itself is called exophoric referencing. To share context, this work is directed at the study of this process between humans and robots.

Joint attention plays an important role in many interactive and collaborative domains. In learning and teaching, joint attention ensures and enforces shared context between two people. While in human-robot interaction, it has become associated with sharing gaze toward a particular target, the function of joint attention, nor it's implementation are laid out in a particular architecture. 

Meanwhile, visual attention has a very active computer vision community. This community core interest is in what part of the field of view the effort should be directed. While gaze and the camera of the camera can be oriented to a particular location, it's not clear what in the field of view is what is being referenced. This differs considerably from the convolutional approach popular in some computer vision communities. Still, whether reference resolution happens post detection or predetection, it still must be computed from the nonverbal gesture's intentions (so called deictic referencing).

The work I performed for my dissertation was partially dedicated to reference resolution applied to the segementation stage of object based reference resolution and partially dedicated to the study of the use of deictic referencing in dynamic scenes. The architecture is meant to enable fast reference resolution for joint attention work performed in dynamic scenes. 

Context sharing going forward, in my belief, could be enabled through the continuous exchange of referencing actions. Further study will be required to understand this challenging subject going forward.
