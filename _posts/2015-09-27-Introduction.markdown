| I am a visiting research scientist at [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) working with [Jessica Hodgins](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jkh/). I graduated from [MIT](https://www.media.mit.edu/) advised by [Cynthia Breazeal](https://cynthiabreazeal.media.mit.edu/). My interests are in understanding the underlying principles behind robotic systems that can communicate with humans. This includes both responding to human nonverbal signals as well as generating those signals as well. I prefer to synthesize commonly understood cognitive processes toward this end. | ![Nick on the beach](images/NickHappy2.PNG ) |
